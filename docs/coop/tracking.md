# Local issue tracking

GitHub is paused (see `AGENTS.md`), so issue status is kept here until it can be
synced. Each row names the GitHub issue, what is true locally, and what to do
on GitHub once use resumes. New work found while GitHub is paused gets an `L`
number and is filed on GitHub later.

Statuses: **done** (acceptance criteria met and verified locally),
**partial**, **in progress**, **open**.

## When GitHub resumes

1. Restore the push URL: `git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:Clodmony/pokerecomp-coop.git`.
2. Push `coop/slice-1` (one local commit ahead of PR #58) and each local branch
   below; open a draft PR per branch.
3. File every `L` item as an issue and replace its `L` number in the docs.
4. Close or comment on the issues as the "On GitHub" column says.

## Branches

| Branch | Base | State | GitHub |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coop/slice-1` | `main` | pushed up to `e5bef608`; `4d8cdaf4` (GitHub pause note) local only | draft PR #58 |
| `coop/m1-state-sync` | `coop/slice-1` | local only: ownership, world and party sync, battle takeover | none yet |

## Issues

| # | Title | Local status | Where | On GitHub |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 to 13 | Slice 1 | done | `coop/slice-1` | closed by PR #58 when merged |
| 16 | Classify every world, save and runtime field | done | `coop/m1-state-sync` (`9efac512`) | close when the branch merges |
| 17 | Run the world logic against a campaign plus player projection | done (each window runs its own world, synced by patches) | `coop/m1-state-sync` (`a151f505`) | close when the branch merges |
| 18 | GameRuntime co-op mode | open | | |
| 25 | Host-side wild encounters and trainer sight per player | partial: the window's world rolls them, the host fights them | `coop/m1-state-sync` (`15028474`) | comment, keep open for host-side generation with #22 |
| 59 | Upstream: dump_tables.gd trainers stops on Generation 1 data | open | | |

## Found while GitHub is paused

| L | Title | Milestone | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Claim trainers fought from a window as unique encounters | M6 | `window_battle` sessions are never unique; two players can fight one trainer at once |
| L2 | Tell a window when its SAVE was refused | M8 | the world says "saved" even when the host refused a checkpoint during a battle |
